  "content": "<h2>Introduction to MVC</h2><p>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern widely used in web development. It separates an application into three interconnected parts.</p><h3>Model</h3><p>The Model represents the application's data structure and business logic. In Laravel, Models typically interact with the database.</p><pre><code class=\"language-php\">namespace App\\Models;\n\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Factories\\HasFactory;\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Model;\n\nclass Post extends Model\n{\n    use HasFactory;\n\n    protected $fillable = [\'title\', \'body\'];\n}\n</code></pre><h3>View</h3><p>The View is the user interface. In Laravel, Views are typically Blade templates that render HTML and display data.</p><pre><code class=\"language-html\">&lt;!-- resources/views/posts/show.blade.php --&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;{{ $post-&gt;title }}&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;{{ $post-&gt;body }}&lt;/p&gt;\n</code></pre><h3>Controller</h3><p>The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It handles user input, interacts with the Model, and selects the appropriate View to render.</p><pre><code class=\"language-php\">namespace App\\Http\\Controllers;\n\nuse App\\Models\\Post;\nuse Illuminate\\Http\\Request;\n\nclass PostController extends Controller\n{\n    public function show(Post $post)\n    {\n        return view(\'posts.show\', [\'post\' =&gt; $post]);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre><h3>How MVC Works in Laravel</h3><p>When a user makes a request, the router directs it to the appropriate Controller. The Controller interacts with the Model to fetch or manipulate data, and then passes that data to the chosen View, which renders the response sent back to the user.</p><p>This separation of concerns makes the application more organized, maintainable, and scalable.</p>"
